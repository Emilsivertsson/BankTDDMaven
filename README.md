# BankTDD
Weekly challange for school

### First try with TDD JunitTests
This program dont really have any funktionality, it looks like a bankaccount, and contains some basic methods.
Its just to be able to run the Junit tests.

## Installation
Clone the project and reload Maven project, to see that Junit is up todate.
Application itself dont have any runability, execute the testclass to check this projects goal.

## Dependencys
[Org.Junit.Jupiter](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api) to run the tests
but its included in the pom.xml file, so you should be able to run it with maven.
